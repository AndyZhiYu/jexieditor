Jexi is a free WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) editor based on Java & SWT library. It comes from the 'Lexi' example in GoF's 'Design Patterns' which is written by C++.

Design goal of Jexi:
Jexi is designed to provide a Java example that may be helpful to learn design patterns.

Next plan:
1. Rewrite with Java 5 gerneric code.
2. Using Swing to replace SWT UI to get a pure Java implementation.
3. More furtures needed to implement...
